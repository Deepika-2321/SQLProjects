Project 3 : Relational Database Design
 
Tasks:
1. Define relations/attributes
2. Define primary keys
3. Create foreign keys

	
In this project, I have worked on converting a relational design that enlists various users, their roles, user accounts, and their statuses into different tables in SQL Server and inserted data into them.

Having at least 2 rows in each of the tables,I have ensured to create respective foreign keys.

The Relational Design that I have used can be found in this respository.
